Nexus - Intelligent Cross-Chain Transaction Optimizer
üöÄ Overview
Nexus is an innovative, AI-powered decentralized application designed to optimize cross-chain cryptocurrency transactions across major EVM-compatible networks. It provides users with real-time insights into gas fees, token prices, and optimal routing paths, leveraging Generative AI to explain complex recommendations in natural language. The goal is to make cross-chain transactions more efficient, cost-effective, and transparent.

‚ú® Key Features
AI-Powered Transaction Optimization: Intelligent backend powered by FastAPI and Python, designed to find the most efficient paths for transactions across multiple EVM chains.

Real-time Data Integration: Integrates with Web3.py for blockchain interaction and CoinGecko API for up-to-the-minute gas prices and token data.

Precise Cost Estimation: Provides accurate USD cost estimations for proposed transactions, including detailed breakdown of network fees.

Natural Language Explanations (Gemini AI): Utilizes the Google Gemini API to translate complex routing logic and recommendations into easy-to-understand natural language.

Intuitive Dashboard: A user-friendly Streamlit frontend for visualizing real-time blockchain metrics, transaction suggestions, and AI-generated insights.

EVM Network Compatibility: Built to support transactions on popular EVM-compatible blockchains.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Backend:

Python: The core language for the backend logic.

FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.

Web3.py: Python library for interacting with Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.

Google Gemini API: For integrating Generative AI capabilities (natural language explanations).

httpx, asyncio, Pydantic: For asynchronous operations and data validation within FastAPI.

CoinGecko API: For fetching real-time cryptocurrency data (prices, gas fees).

Frontend:

Streamlit: For building the interactive, data-rich web dashboard.

Blockchain/Web3 Concepts:

EVM-compatible Blockchains

Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Gas Optimization

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The Nexus system consists of two main components:

FastAPI Backend (Python):

Handles all core logic for transaction optimization.

Interacts with blockchain networks via Web3.py.

Fetches real-time market data from CoinGecko.

Processes user queries and generates recommendations using Generative AI (Google Gemini API).

Streamlit Frontend (Python):

Provides a graphical user interface for users to input transaction details.

Displays real-time data, optimized transaction paths, and AI-powered explanations.

Communicates with the FastAPI backend to send requests and receive optimized results.

üöÄ Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get a local copy of Nexus up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Natasha-cyber777/Nexus-Router.git
cd Nexus-Router

Create and activate a virtual environment:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Install backend dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(You might need to create a requirements.txt file first if it doesn't exist, by running pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing your backend dependencies like fastapi, uvicorn[standard], web3, google-generativeai, python-dotenv, httpx, pydantic.)

Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your sensitive API keys and configurations:

# Google Gemini API Key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY

# Add any other API keys like CoinGecko (if needed for authenticated access)
# ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY

NEVER commit your .env file to Git! Ensure it's listed in your .gitignore.

Obtain your Google Gemini API key from the Google AI Studio.

Run the FastAPI backend:

uvicorn main:app --reload

The backend will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Frontend (Streamlit) Setup
Install frontend dependencies:
(Still within the activated virtual environment)

pip install streamlit

(And any other Streamlit specific dependencies if you had them separate, or ensure they're in your requirements.txt and installed from step 3 above.)

Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py

(Assuming your main Streamlit file is app.py. Adjust if your Streamlit entry point is different).
The Streamlit app will open in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.

üí° Usage
Start both the FastAPI backend and the Streamlit frontend as described in the "Installation & Setup" section.

Open the Streamlit application in your web browser (e.g., http://localhost:8501).

Use the intuitive interface to select your desired cryptocurrencies, target chains, and transaction amounts.

Nexus will provide real-time optimal routing suggestions, detailed cost breakdowns, and clear explanations generated by AI.

üõ£Ô∏è Future Enhancements
Integration with Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): Directly execute swaps via integrated DEXs.

Advanced AI Models: Explore more sophisticated AI/ML models for predictive analytics on gas prices and liquidity.

Wallet Integration: Direct wallet connection (e.g., MetaMask) for seamless transaction signing.

Notifications: Real-time alerts for optimal transaction windows.

Broader Blockchain Support: Expand to non-EVM chains.

Detailed Analytics: More in-depth visualization of transaction data and network health.
